\usage{
process_MF(
  LHS,
  RHS,
  LHS_lags = 1,
  RHS_lags = 1,
  as_of = NULL,
  frq = c("auto", "week", "month", "quarter", "year", "other"),
  date_name = "ref_date",
  id_name = "series_name",
  value_name = "value",
  pub_date_name = "pub_date",
  return_dt = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{LHS}{Left hand side data in long format. May include multiple LHS variables, but LHS variance MUST have the same frequency.}

\item{RHS}{Right hand side data in long format at any frequency.}

\item{LHS_lags}{Number of lags of LHS variables to include in output.}

\item{RHS_lags}{Number of lags of RHS variables to include in output (may be 0, indicating contemporaneous values only).}

\item{as_of}{Backtesting the model "as of" this date; requires that `pub_date` is specified in the data}

\item{frq}{Frequency of LHS data, one of 'week', 'month', 'quarter', 'year'. If not specified, the function will attempt to automatically identify the frequency.}

\item{date_name}{Name of date column in data.}

\item{id_name}{Name of ID column in the data.}

\item{value_name}{Name of value column in the data.}

\item{pub_date_name}{Name of publication date in the data.}

\item{return_dt}{T/F, should the function return a `data.table`? IF FALSE the function will return matrix data.}
}
\value{
data.table in long format (unless `return_dt = FALSE`). Variables ending in '0' are contemporaneous, ending in '1' are at one lag, '2' at two lags, etc.
}
\description{
Process mixed frequency data for nowcasting applications by identifying the
missing observations in the contemporaneous data and replicating this pattern
of missing observations in the historical data prior to aggregation. This allows
the incorporation of all available information into the model while still using 
uniform frequency models to actually generate predictions, and can thus be applied
to a wide array of econometrics and machine learning applications.
}
\details{
Right hand side data will always include observations contemporaneous with LHS data. Use `RHS_lags` to add lags
of RHS data to the output, and `LHS_lags` to add lags of LHS data to the output. By default the function will return
data in long format designed to be used with the `dateutils` function `process()`. Specifying `return_dt = FALSE` will 
return LHS variables in the matrix `Y`, RHS variables in the matrix `X`, and corresponding dates (by index) in the
date vector `dates`. Forecast horizon is always one step ahead of the latest observation.

LHS <- fred[series_name == "gdp constant prices"]
RHS <- fred[series_name != "gdp constant prices"]
dt <- process_MF(LHS, RHS)
